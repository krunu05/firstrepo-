1. Inline CSS :- 
                  Definition: CSS is written directly inside the HTML element using the style attribute.

 Advantages:

            Quick to apply.

            Overrides other CSS types (highest priority).

Disadvantages:

                Hard to maintain for large projects.

                Violates separation of content and style.

               Code becomes messy with many styles.



2. Internal CSS :-
                 Definition: CSS is placed within a <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document.

                 Used for: Styling a single HTML page.

Advantages:

                   Keeps CSS separate from content (better than inline).

                   Useful for small projects or one-page websites.
 Disadvantages:

                   Styles are limited to that one HTML file.

                   Still less scalable than external CSS.                   


3. External CSS
                Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

                 Used for: Styling multiple HTML pages consistently. 

Advantages:

                 Reusable across many pages.

                 Easy to maintain and update.

                 Keeps content and design separate (best practice).

Disadvantages:

                 Needs an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file.

                 Changes may not reflect if the file is cached.
